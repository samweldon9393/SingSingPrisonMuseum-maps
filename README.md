## Overview

This repository contains a React.js + TypeScript application developed for the **Sing Sing Prison Museum** as part of my fellowship. The application will be installed in the museum’s visitor center as an **interactive digital exhibit**, giving guests a way to explore how the **architecture of confinement** has evolved over the 200-year history of Sing Sing Prison.

The app visualizes changes in cell blocks, workspaces, and communal areas through historical maps, illustrations, and archival materials. Visitors can navigate across different eras of the prison’s development, bringing together scholarship, primary sources, and visual storytelling.
